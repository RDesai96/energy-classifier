Energy Classifier
STAT 656 - Texas A&M

For a quick summary of the project, see the project powerpoint pdf called "Energy_ppt.pdf" in the root directory.


OVERVIEW:

This project seeks to analyze utility scale renewable projects (i.e. wind farms and solar farms)
and seeks to answer the following questions:

    1. Are the current locations of these projects efficient?
        a. Are local measures of wind/solar potential good classifiers for the presence of
           a solar vs a wind project for a given area?
    2. How accurate of a classifier can be built taking into account the current locations of
       utility scale solar and wind projects?
        a. If an accurate classifier can be built using solar/wind potential as inputs, then we
           can surmise that the current locations of these projects are, at the very least, efficient.
        b. If an accurate classifier cannot be built, then it is worth exploring whether federal,
           state, and local governments should re-evaluate their approach when building utility scale
           projects in their region.


Data:


I have included the code I used to scrape and clean the data in the data/dataretrieval
directory as a courtesy, but be warned that urls, paths, and even the actual data
is susceptible to changes that I cannot account for.

I highly recommend simply downloading the nice, prepared dataset at the link below:
