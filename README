OVERVIEW:

The U.S. policy toward renewable energy has been fairly laissez-faire save for the occasional subsidy,
relying primarily on market forces to drive the energy transition. By default, this has led to a
decentralized approach, where disparate actors across the country have pursued transitioning to clean energy
in their own ways.

This project seeks to analyze utility scale renewables (i.e. wind farms and solar farms) and seeks to answer
the following questions:

    1. Are the current locations of these projects efficient?
        a. Does the choice of a wind farm vs a solar farm in a given location make sense?
        b. Are local measures of wind/solar potential good classifiers for the presence of
           a solar vs a wind project for a given area?
    2. How accurate of a classifier can be built taking into account the current locations of
       utility scale solar and wind projects?
        a. If an accurate classifier can be built using solar/wind potential as inputs, then
           we can surmise that the current market approach to renewables is at the very least,
           efficient.
        b. If an accurate classifier cannot be built, then it is worth exploring whether federal,
           state, and local governments should consider more centralized forms of planning when building
           utility scale projects in their region.
